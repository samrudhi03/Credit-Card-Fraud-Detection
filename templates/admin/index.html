        <h4>Credit Card Fraud Detection with Python & Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>
            For any bank or financial organization, credit card fraud detection is of utmost importance. We have to spot
            potential fraud so that consumers can not bill for goods that they havenâ€™t purchased. The aim is, therefore,
            to create a classifier that indicates whether a requested transaction is a fraud.

        <h4>About Credit Card Fraud Detection</h4>
        <p>
            In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions using
            machine numpy, scikit learn, and few other python libraries. We overcome the problem by creating a binary
            classifier and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to see which fits better.
